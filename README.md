# Background

Conference realignment is one of the biggest topics in college sports. Many college athletic programs are switching conferences with the hopes of becoming more competitive in terms of recruiting, facilities, media exposure, and results on the field. One of the biggest benefits to conference realignment is the renuve the schools can possibly make over tv and media rights, no matter how the successful the program is. Majority of the time, football is the driving force to switching conferences and other sports within the athletic program don't usually have a say in the move (Due to the fact that football financially sports a lot of the non-revenue sports within the athletic department). Although considered amateur athletics, college football is a multi-billion dollar business.

College realignment has allowed many football teams to gain financial success, but can we say the same when it comes to success on the field?

# Questions

<u>Primary Question</u>

Does changing conferences actually lead to better results or success on the field?


<u>Secondary Questions</u>

Through analysis of the data, we would also like to find out:

1. Which teams had the highest winning percentage (Overall, Previous Conference(s), and Current Conference)?
2. Which teams had the lowest winning percentage (Overall, Previous Conference(s), and Current Conference)?
3. Which teams had the highest Bowl Game winning percentage (Overall, Previous Conference(s), and Current Conference)?
4. Which teams had the lowest Bowl Game winning percentage (Overall, Previous Conference(s), and Current Conference)?
5. What is the total winning percentage for all teams that have changed conferences since the BCS era (1998-Present)?
6. What year did most of the conference realignment occur?
7. Random interesting information we may find from analyzing the data.

<u>*Note*</u>: *We are only analyzing teams that have switched conferences from The Bowl Championship Series (BCS) era to present (1998-Present). Notre Dame's one year in the ACC due to rules regarding the COVID-19 pandemic will not be included in this data. We are only looking at wins, losses, and ties both overall and in conference from the BCS era to present. We are only looking at national championships at the FBS level. We are looking at conference championships throughout the entire football program's history*.
